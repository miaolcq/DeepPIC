# DeepPIC
Deep Learning-based Pure Ion Chromatogram Extraction for LC-MS.
Liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS) can detect thousands of features in metabolomics samples. Traditional extracted ion chromatograms and region of interest (ROI) methods can split peaks due to fixed m/z bias. Pure ion chromatograms (PIC) are ion traces consisting of ions from the same analyte, and PIC-based methods have been proposed to address the split peak problem in traditional methods.   A A deep learning based pure ion chromatogram method (DeepPIC) has been developed to extract PICs directly from raw LC-MS files.
The method has a high sensitivity and precision, reliable quantification capability and wide adaptability. It provides the entire pipeline from raw data to discriminant model for metabolomic datasets.
